            <h1>Minimalist makeup: examples and trends</h1>

            <p><strong>Minimalism</strong> is based on a concept that seeks to make use of few and fundamental elements. It can be applied in the construction of environments, in the wardrobe, in the consumption of daily products and even in make-up.
            
            In this case, the aesthetics of the face, the idea that less is more applies perfectly. In <strong><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/minimalist-makeup" target="_blank">minimalist makeup</a></strong>, only what is essential for you will be used. The intention is to enhance, through a minimum coverage, the curves of the face and even aspects of the face, such as blemishes and acne. Re-signifying them is one of the intentions of this make-up movement.</p>

            <h2>What is minimalist makeup?</h2>

            <p>The concept of <strong>minimalist makeup</strong> applies both to the amount of products we keep – or even accumulate – in our makeup bag, as well as the amount of products we apply to our face.

            There is an infinity of products for each region of the face: skin, eyes, eyelashes, eyebrows, lips, etc. As much of a makeup fan as you are, minimalism comes to remind us that products have an expiration date and we can hardly use them all in time.
                
            This doesn't mean that you can't buy the product you want in a beauty store or even online, but it shows us that we should be more aware when making a purchase. Many makeup products end up making waves on the internet and, consequently, inducing us to buy them. Ask yourself: do I really need this? Will it be useful in my daily life?
                
            Doing a real clean by checking the expiration date on all your products is a great idea to start applying minimalism. This way, you will be able to visualize more clearly what you really use – and what you stopped using.</p>
